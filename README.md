The project was to design a flowchart and later code for a clock with specific formatting requirements. 
I modularized and organized everything nicely. I also did well designing the code to meet the requirements.
Something I can improve on is my flowcharts and organizing my code beforehand. This would help guide me better and prevent wasted time or redundant code.
The parts of code I struggled with were the parts that were given to us. There were a few things in the rewritten code that I did not understand or know how to use at first. There are a variety of online learning and support tools for new coders and reviewing these helped me significantly.
I think the biggest takeaway from this course would be how and when to integrate a second language to a project.
Most of everything had comments explaining the purpose of each part. Also the main function was reduced with most of the code in auxiliary functions.
